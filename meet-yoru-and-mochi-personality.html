    <h1>Meet Yoru and Mochi: Two Guinea Pigs With Very Different Personalities</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      At first glance, Yoru and Mochi are just two cute guinea pigs.
      But the longer you watch them, the more you realize they couldn’t be more different.
    </p>

    <h2>Mochi: Expressive, Reactive, Honest</h2>
    <p>
      Mochi wears her emotions openly.
      She reacts quickly to the world around her—freezing dramatically, clutching food tightly,
      and making decisions based entirely on instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s no hiding how she feels.
      When she’s excited, you know.
      When she’s unsure, you see it immediately.
      Mochi is honest in a way that feels refreshing.
    </p>

    <h2>Yoru: Calm, Observant, Unbothered</h2>
    <p>
      Yoru moves through the world differently.
      He watches before acting.
      He sits still when others would rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      His calm isn’t passive—it’s intentional.
      Yoru doesn’t react unless something truly matters,
      and that quiet confidence makes his presence feel grounding.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Their Dynamic Feels Real</h2>
    <p>
      Together, Yoru and Mochi create a balance that feels natural.
      Expression and stillness.
      Reaction and observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They don’t perform roles.
      They simply exist side by side, each comfortable being exactly who they are.
      That authenticity is what people connect with.
    </p>

    <h2>Why People Want to Know Them</h2>
    <p>
      People don’t just watch Yoru and Mochi because they’re cute.
      They watch because these two small lives feel real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their moments are quiet, unforced, and familiar—
      reminders that personality doesn’t need to be loud to be meaningful.
