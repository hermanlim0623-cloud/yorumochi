  <h1>The Story of Yoru & Mochi</h1>

  <p>Yoru & Mochi are two small companions who are always together. They love playing, resting, eating, and exploring their little world with endless curiosity.</p>

  <p>Yoru has a darker color and a more serious expression, while Mochi looks brighter, gentle, and cheerful. This contrast is what makes them such a unique duo.</p>

  <p>Every day brings something new — from tasting fresh vegetables, running around their play area, to quietly leaning on each other during nap time.</p>

  <p>We share these small moments with the world to bring comfort, smiles, and a sense of calm to everyone who watches.</p>

  <p>Follow their full journey on our official platforms!</p>
